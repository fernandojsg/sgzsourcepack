      Notes


          Done in roughly 5 nights. We know, BCN probably
          deserved a better demo. Anyway, this time we felt
          like doing something a bit different, more
          aggresive. It was intended to be shown on a party
          bigscreen with a powerful soundsystem and all the
          crowd in that special compo mood you all know :]

          And for those who don't get the melon logo thing,
          it obviously ain't a rip, but a little tribute to
          a part of their booo2 demo I (ithaqua) always liked.

          See .it sample list for details about the music.
